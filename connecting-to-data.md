1.  **Getting Familiar with Tableau**
    - If you haven't already, [download and install](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students){:target="_blank"} Tableau for Students
    - Open Tableau Desktop and get familiar with the interface
        - Discover Pane (right): Educational resources and links to relevant content
        - Recent Flows (middle): Previous files are displayed here.
        - Connections Pane (left): Select a data source
2.  **Getting Started With Data**
    - In Connections Pane (left), click **Microsoft Excel**. Open the **Global Superstore Orders 2016.xlsx** file you downloaded to your computer or, if you haven't already, <a href="https://github.com/richmccue/tableau/raw/main/resources/Global%20Superstore%20Orders%202016.xlsx">download it now</a>
    - In the Connections Pane (see animation below), we see all the sheets in the Excel file. Drag the **Orders** sheet into the flow pane as shown
    - The **Orders** sheet can be renamed by simply double-clicking on the column name. Rename the sheet to **Global Superstore Orders**
    - The data itself is viewable in the data grid. You can rename a column by double-clicking on the column name (see animation below).
    - You can also change the default data type by clicking on the data icon as shown. There are 5 data types: numeric (<img src="images\activity-1\mini-icon-1.png" alt="numeric symbol" style="width:30px;">), text (<img src="images\activity-1\mini-icon-2.png" alt="text symbol" style="width:30px;">), geospatial (<img src="images\activity-1\mini-icon-3.png" alt="geospacial symbol" style="width:30px;">), date(<img src="images\activity-1\mini-icon-4.png" alt="date symbol" style="width:30px;">), and date-and-time (<img src="images\activity-1\mini-icon-5.png" alt="date and time symbol" style="width:30px;">)

     </div>

    

3.  **Working With Data**
    - Click the **Sheet 1** tab on the bottom toolbar to create our first worksheet
    
    <img src="images\activity-1\tab.png" alt="bottom toolbar" style="width:480px;">
    
    - We see column names on the left side menu, broken up into dimensions (blue) and measures (green). Dimensions are fields that cannot be aggregated; Measures are fields that can be measured, aggregated, or used for mathematical operations
    - Let's get the relationship between two variables: Sales (in Measures), and Order Date (in Dimensions)
        - Click and drag the **Sales** measure into the **Rows** shelf (top)
        - In the dialogue box that appears, select **AVG(Sales)** for average sales
        - Click and drag the **Order Date** dimension into the **Columns** shelf (top)
        

    <button onclick="toggle('gif2')">Show/Hide Animation</button>
<div id="gif2">
          <img src="images\activity-1\relationship.gif" alt="setting up a relationship animated" style="width:720px;"><br>
     </div>


          
- In the dialogue box that appears, select **YEAR(Order Date)**. In Tableau, it will automatically create a visualization

    - Click the **"+"** in the **YEAR(Order Date)** blue pill and drill down to get quarters
    - Click **Show Me** (top right) to display the different plot types that Tableau recommends. Try a few and think about their effect on the 4 data visualization principles
    
    <img src="images\activity-1\show-me.png" alt="different plot types" style="width:720px;">
    
    - The **Marks** card area (to the left of the visualization charts) is where you can control the visual features of your plot, Try changing the colour and size
    - You can also control the visual appearance of your plot according to dimensions of interest. For example, right-click drag the **Category** dimension onto the **Color** card. Select **Category** in the dialogue box that appears. Please note that the dialog box does not always appear

<button onclick="toggle('gif3')">Show/Hide Animation</button>
<div id="gif3">
           <img src="images\activity-1\style-change.gif" alt="changing graph styles" style="width:720px;"><br>
     </div>

   

<script>  

    function toggle(input) {
        var x = document.getElementById(input);
        if (x.style.display === "none") {
            x.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
    }
</script>
